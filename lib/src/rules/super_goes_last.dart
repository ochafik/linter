const details = '''
From the [style guide](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/):

**DO** place the `super()` call last in a constructor initialization list.

Field initializers are evaluated in the order that they appear in the
constructor initialization list. If you place a `super()` call in the
middle of an initializer list, the superclass's initializers will be evaluated
right then before evaluating the rest of the subclass's initializers.

What it doesn't mean is that the superclass's constructor body will be executed
then. That always happens after all initializers are run regardless of where
`super()` appears. It's vanishingly rare that the order of initializers
matters, so the placement of `super()` in the list almost never matters
either.

Getting in the habit of placing it last improves consistency, visually
reinforces when the superclass's constructor body is run, and may help
performance.

**GOOD:**
```
View(Style style, List children)
    : _children = children,
      super(style) {
```

**BAD:**
```
View(Style style, List children)
    : super(style),
      _children = children {
```
