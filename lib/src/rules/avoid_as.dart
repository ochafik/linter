const desc = r'Avoid using `as`.';

const details = r'''
From the [flutter style guide]
(https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/sky/specs/style-guide.md):

**AVOID** using `as`.

If you know the type is correct, use an assertion or assign to a more
narrowly-typed variable (this avoids the type check in release mode; `as`
is not compiled out in release mode). If you don't know whether the type is
correct, check using `is` (this avoids the exception that `as` raises).


**BAD:**
```
(pm as Person).firstName = 'Seth';
```

**GOOD:**
```
Person person = pm;
person.firstName = 'Seth';
```

or

**GOOD:**
```
if (pm is Person)
  pm.firstName = 'Seth';
```

but certainly not

**BAD:**
```
try {
   (pm as Person).firstName = 'Seth';
} on CastError { }

```

Note that an exception is made in the case of `dynamic` since the cast has no
performance impact.

**OK:**
```
HasScrollDirection scrollable = renderObject as dynamic;
```
